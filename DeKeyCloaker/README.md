When I was pretty new to python, I was trying to scrape some data from a website that I had authenticated access to, but it had a pretty sophisticated OATH2 authentication setup. This is what was left of trying to detect and automate the keycloak session. It's the product of a very educational deep dive into the Keycloak API, OATH2, SAML, and some related areas. I had a pretty good way ahead, I think.

Then I discovered Selenium exists, and the problem became one I didn't need to solve. Lesson: always check for a library first.

It would be an interesting project just for fun though, so I'm keeping it around.
