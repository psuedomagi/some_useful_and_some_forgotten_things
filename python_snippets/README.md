A smattering of Python snippets that I wrote for various purposes. They tend toward small utilities as opposed to snippets, but I'm not going to change the name of the repository.


1. countrytocontinent.py - converts two-letter country codes to continent names
2. csvtosql - converts a CSV file to an sqlite database
3. object_inspector.py - uses the inspect module to print out all the attributes of an object
4. parse_write_aws_yaml.py - parses an AWS cloudformation YAML template into a dictionary and another function that writes the dictionary back to a YAML file
5. posixday_to_iso.py - converts a POSIX day to an ISO date
5. TypeDict.py - a dictionary that generates a type schema for a dictionary.... not finished.
