A smattering of Python snippets that I wrote for various purposes.
```

1. countrytocontinent.py - converts two-letter country codes to continent names
2. csvtosql - converts a CSV file to an sqlite database
3. object_inspector.py - uses the inspect module to print out all the attributes of an object
4. parse_write_aws_yaml.py - parses an AWS cloudformation YAML template into a dictionary and another function that writes the dictionary back to a YAML file
5. posixday_to_iso.py - converts a POSIX day to an ISO date
