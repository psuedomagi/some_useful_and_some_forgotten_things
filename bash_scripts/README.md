A collection of bash scripts I've made for various purposes.

1. bootfs-monitor.sh - Monitors the boot file system for changes using the Linux kernel's inotify feature, and if it changes, triggers a backup.
2. create_nvidia_nodes.sh - Create the nvidia nodes for udev... was used to troubleshoot a problem with nvidia's stock udev rules.
3. hidrawmatch.sh - A script to match hidraw devices to their corresponding tty devices.
4. kernel-cleaner.sh - A script to clean up old kernels.
5. windowid.sh - A script to get the window ID of the currently focused window.
